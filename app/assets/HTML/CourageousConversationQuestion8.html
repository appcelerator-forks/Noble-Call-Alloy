What is the most powerful thing we can agree to ask God for?</h1>    <p>This question is an acknowledgment of Psalm 55:22. We are to cast back on      the Lord all our burdens that a conversation like this can create. We now      know our responsibilities and the preferable future and we will either try      to do it in the power of our flesh or we will cast our burdens on the Lord      and acknowledge our weakness and dependence on Him to perform all things      for us. When we agree in prayer right then we invite God&#8217;s power to impact      this issue. Psalm 133 says that God commands a blessing when brethren      dwell together in unity.</p>  </body></html>
