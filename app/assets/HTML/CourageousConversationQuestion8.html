    <h1 class="red">8a. What is the most powerful thing we can agree
      to ask God for? </h1>
    <h1 class="red">8b. Do you feel the need to ask forgiveness from God and
      from each other based on the revelations from this conversation?</h1>
    <p>This question is an acknowledgment of <button class="bibleref">Psalm 55:22</button> We are to cast back on the Lord all our burdens that a
      conversation like this can create. We now know our responsibilities and
      the preferable future and we will either try to do it in the power of our
      flesh or we will cast our burdens on the Lord and acknowledge our weakness
      and dependence on Him to perform all things for us. When we agree in
      prayer right then we invite God?s power to impact this issue. <button class="bibleref">Psalm
        133</button> s ays that God commands a blessing when brethren dwell
      together in unity.</p>
    <p>The second part of this question allows you to search your heart to see
      if there are things that you need to repent to God and/or to your spouse
      for as part of understanding the root causes behind this conversation.</p>
