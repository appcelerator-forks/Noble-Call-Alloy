What does the preferable future look like to you?</h1>    <p>Questions 7 &amp; 8 are about the preferable future. This question turns      the focus on what has been to what could and should be. It creates hope in      the people because they begin to share a vision that both can agree on.      When they realize how much they agree on their desired future they begin      to walk together in agreement. This question begins to restore a sense of      partnership and enthusiasm for what could and should be in their      relationship and organization. God begins to give them a pure heart to see      the future as he sees it, full of plans for good and not for evil.</p>    <p>Restate what you heard them say the preferable future could be.</p>  </body></html>
