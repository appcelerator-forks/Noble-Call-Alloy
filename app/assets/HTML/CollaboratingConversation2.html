    <h1 class="tan">Develop A Noble Plan</h1>
    <p>This involves God's will, God's way, God's resources, God's timing, and
      God's blessing. </p>
    <h2 class="tan">God's Will</h2>
    <p>This is <em>doing the right thing.</em> You need to ensure that your
      plan is in line with God's will and the "latter end". This means to see
      your plan and its results from God's perspective. <button type="button" class="bibleref">
        Deuteronomy 32:29 </button> <button type="button" class="bibleref">

    <ul>
      <li>What do you believe God' desired results are?</li>
      <li>What are your desired results?</li>
      <li>As a person, partner, parent, provider, and proclaimer?</li>
      <li>What does the preferable future look like?</li>
      <li>What does success look like?

      <li>What does failure look like?

    </ul>
    <h2 class="tan">God's Way</h2>
    <p>This is <em>doing the right thing in the right way.</em> This explains
      the what and the how of the decision making process. You will need to
      think about the Commands of Christ, the Character of Christ, the driving
      forces, and discern your level of willingness. </p>
    <h3 class="tan">The Commands of Christ</h3>
    <p>What commands apply in this situation?</p>
    <h3 class="tan">The Character of Christ</h3>
    <p>What character qualities will be essential for evaluating the situation,
      generating alternatives, choosing a solution, and implementing it? </p>
    <h3 class="tan">Driving Forces</h3>
    <p>Think about the driving forces (causing you to need to make this decision
      or will help you to effect the solution) and the restraining forces
      (obstacles or attitudes that will impede you). This is also called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_field_analysis">Forcefield
        Analysis</a>. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Are you operating out of pride?</li>
      <li>Are there wounds (trauma A or B) that are influencing the situation?</li>
      <li>What belief system are you operating under? If it is lies, "either or"
        vs "win win", you need to check your core beliefs about the problem.</li>
      <li>Are you operating out of sin, either willful or foolish?</li>
      <li>Are there bio-chemical forces at play? Are you overtired, hungry,
        other?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="tan">God's Resources</h3>
    <p>This is <em>doing the right thing in the right way with the right stuff.</em>
      The right stuff can include equipment, training, space, and people. </p>
    <h3 class="tan">God's Timing</h3>
    <p>This is <em>doing the right thing in the right way with the right stuff
        with the right timing.</em> </p>

    <p>This is <em>doing the right thing in the right way with the right stuff

    <ul>
      <li>What will be the rewards of doing God's will in His way, in His
