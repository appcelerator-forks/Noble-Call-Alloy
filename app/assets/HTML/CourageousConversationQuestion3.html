How is this affecting you? </h1>    <h1 class="red">3b. When you feel that way how do you act?</h1>    <p>Questions 3 &amp; 4 deal with the painful consequences of an issue. The      beatitude of mourning can be displayed by the listener as they show      empathy for the other person. When a person feels heard and cared about      they can begin to move on to resolving their issues. It is a rare      experience for most people to feel safe enough to talk about anything      because there are so few people who can listen from another&#8217;s perspective.      One definition of intimacy I like is <em>&#8220;In To Me See.&#8221;</em> When we      look through another person&#8217;s eyes and see as they see we can begin to      understand why they are behaving the way they are.</p>    <p>When you take the brunt of their intense emotions and don&#8217;t defend      yourself, but mourn over what you may have caused or what others have      contributed to, you are following the command <em>&#8220;to rejoice with those        who rejoice and mourn with those who mourn.&#8221;</em> It also allows you to      see just how serious of an issue this is and what the cause and effects      are for yourself and the organization.</p>    <p>Rephrase what you heard the person say to their satisfaction. This is a      part of engaging in the conversation and helping the person feel      understood.</p>    <p>The second part of this question allows you to see how that person acts      when they feel a certain way. They may get angry, they may withdraw, they      may get busy. It's a clue for you for the future as to how they might be      feeling when you see that action taking place.</p>  </body></html>
