Don't get stuck in a either/or mentality but    learn how to collaborate and come into a both/and paradigm. Avoid all    extremes <button type="button" class="bibleref"> Ecclesiastes 7:18 </button>    and recognize that true wisdom has two sides. <button type="button" class="bibleref">      Job 11:6 </button>    <p>The first thing you need to do is to decide how you are going to decide      and then you need to develop a noble plan. </p>    <h3 class="tan">Decide How You Are Going To Decide</h3>    First decide which of the four Biblical decision models you will use:    <ol>      <li>Command</li>      <li>Counsel</li>      <li>Choice</li>      <li>Consensus</li>    </ol>    <h4 class="tan">Command</h4>    You alone will determine the criteria for evaluating alternatives and select    the solution or direction. You are simply informing your spouse that this is    happening and that you will let her know when the decision is made. This    model may require you to sell the decision in order to gain a sufficient    level of commitment.    <h4 class="tan">Counsel</h4>    You will invite your spouse and potentially others in to provide you advice    but you will select the final solution or direction yourself. This model    provides a higher level of commitment because your spouse has had input into    the decision.    <h4 class="tan">Choice</h4>    You have accounted for various solutions, all of which are acceptable to you    (or at least the pros and cons are well understood), and want your spouse to    help you make a choice between them.    <h4 class="tan">Consensus</h4>    You are inviting your spouse into the discussion as an equal. The key to    this model is that you must build a common view around the decision and you    are willing to keep your influence equal to that of others providing input.    This model has the highest level of commitment but may require you to    compromise on certain factors that you consider important.    <p> You will need to take into consideration the circumstances and the      amount of cooperation and commitment you will need from other people to      decide how you are going to decide. </p>  </body></html>
