What is your most pressing issue?</h1>    <p>Questions 1 &amp; 2 deal with the <em>Pressing Issues.</em> Very rarely      do I ever ask someone if they would like to have a courageous      conversation. I simply realize that there is a problem because someone is      either acting hurt or trying to get me to understand their viewpoint. When      I see that a conversation is turning combustible because I don&#8217;t feel      understood or the other person is frustrated, it dawns on me that I need      to humble myself and esteem the others need to be heard as greater than my      own.&nbsp; This is the third beatitude of Jesus:&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;<span class="biblequote">God
        blesses the humble, for they will inherit the whole earth.</span>&#8221; I      will simply say, <em>&#8220;What I hear you saying is that your most pressing        issue is&#8230;&#8221;</em> or I will say <em>&#8220;What I hear you saying is&#8230;, which of        these is the most pressing issue?&#8221;</em></p>    <table>    </table>  </body></html>
