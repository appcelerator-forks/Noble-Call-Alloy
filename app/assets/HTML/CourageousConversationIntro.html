        on the ten questions</a>. It is not only important that you know the      questions but also understand the goal of the conversation and the      thinking and nuances behind each question. </p>    <p> If you have heard Chris speak recently, you may have heard him talk      about having a <em>Courageous Conversation.</em> These are conversations      that require us to blend two key elements of mercy and truth in order to      resolve pressing issues and at the same time develop greater levels of      trust in our relationship. <br>    </p>    <p><button type="button" class="bibleref">Proverbs 16:6</button> states "By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the      fear of the LORD men depart from evil." The iniquities of      self-will, and our pride is what causes so much of the tension in our      relationships. Our pride reveals itself in our conversations when we say      to ourselves, &#8220;we will have had a good conversation when you listen to me      and agree that I&#8217;m right.&#8221;    </p>    <p>This form of conversation does not include God&#8217;s mercy and truth which      sets us free, but it focuses on our own rights and expectations which      cause wars among us as James 4 points out so clearly. </p>    <p> When he has helped mediate courageous conversations where people have      been more interested in seeking to give mercy and truth rather than being      right, he has seen truly miraculous reconciliation take place. God has      said &#8220;And having made peace through the blood of His cross, by Him to      reconcile all things unto Himself; by Him, I say, whether they be things      in earth, or things in heaven.&#8221;    </p>    <p>God has already done his part, the question is will we receive the grace      He has already provided by humbling ourselves and allowing our iniquities      to be purged by His mercy and truth. When our sins are pointed out and we      humble ourselves and confess them, God cleanses us.    </p>    <p>    He has seen people become so free that they have a fresh fear of God come    upon them as they see His power made manifest in their lives and    relationship. They depart from further evil so they can experience a greater    level of intimacy and freedom in Christ.    </p>    <p> The three goals of a courageous conversation are: </p>    <ul>      <li> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Wisdom to see from a bigger          perspective.</span> When we see as God sees we will want to do as        God does. The counsel of others will broaden our perspective. God can        even use a donkey to help us see our blind spots. He will test our        humility by sending us the most unlikely messengers. </li>      <li> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Understanding that will establish          trust in the relationship. </span>When we see from another&#8217;s        perspective we begin to understand why they do what they do. When you        seek to understand a person, it doesn&#8217;t mean you have to agree with        them. When you provide them a safe environment of mercy, it will allow        them to see their own false beliefs and begin to question their        perspective if it is based on lies. A man convinced against his own will        is of the same opinion still. Our goal is to look with another person at        their own thoughts and beliefs so they consider the trustworthiness of        their perspective. </li>      <li> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Knowledge so we can take the next          step.</span> When people gain wisdom and understanding by        allowing the beatitudes of Christ to control their spirit, soul and        body, then God will grant them the knowledge of His will to resolve any        issue. </li>    </ul>  </body></html>
