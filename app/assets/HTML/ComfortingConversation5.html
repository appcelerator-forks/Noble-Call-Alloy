He wants you to make unwise choices based on F.E.A.R. so he can      kill your body, rob you of your ﬁnances, and destroy your relationships. </p>    <table>      <tbody>        <tr>          <td style="vertical-align:top;" width="48"><img src="images/Illuminated_Letter_F.gif"              alt="F"              height="48"              width="48"></td>          <td><strong>False</strong></td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td style="vertical-align:top;" width="48"><img src="images/Illuminated_Letter_E.gif"              alt="E"              height="48"              width="48"></td>          <td><strong>Evidence</strong></td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td style="vertical-align:top;" width="48"><img src="images/Illuminated_Letter_A.gif"              alt="A"              height="48"              width="48"></td>          <td> That <strong>Appears</strong></td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td style="vertical-align:top;" width="48"><img src="images/Illuminated_Letter_R.gif"              alt="R"              height="48"              width="48"></td>          <td><strong>Real</strong></td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>    <p> It becomes a story when we do not have all the facts and we need to ﬁll      in the gaps with our own imagination or the accuser of the brethren helps      us ﬁll in the gaps with his F.E.A.R. </p>    <p> It is not the facts that create the emotion, it is the story we create      around the facts. </p>    <p> The meaning determines the feeling. We need to be aware of the meaning      we are attaching to the facts and then challenge that meaning with the      truth. Often times it means seeking counsel from others so we can      recognize reality and allow truth to set us free. </p>  </body></html>
