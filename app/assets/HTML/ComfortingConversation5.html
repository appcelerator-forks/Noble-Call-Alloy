How Does It Make You Feel?</h1>    <p> Satan is a deceiver and the father of lies, he will try to capture your      thoughts ﬁrst, then he will help you create a story ﬁlled with half      truths, lies and accusations so he can capture your emotions and ﬁnally      your will. He wants you to make unwise choices based on F.E.A.R. so he can      kill your body, rob you of your ﬁnances, and destroy your relationships. </p>    <img style="width: 100%;" title="F" alt="False" src="images/FEAR-F.png"><br>    <img style="width: 100%;" title="E" alt="Evidence" src="images/FEAR-E.png"><br>    <img style="width: 100%;" title="A" alt="That Appears" src="images/FEAR-A.png"><br>    <img style="width: 100%;" title="R" alt="Real" src="images/FEAR-R.png"><br>    <p> It becomes a story when we do not have all the facts and we need to ﬁll      in the gaps with our own imagination or the accuser of the brethren helps      us ﬁll in the gaps with his F.E.A.R. </p>    <p> <strong>It is not the facts that create the emotion, it is the story we        create around the facts. </strong></p>    <p> The meaning determines the feeling. We need to be aware of the meaning      we are attaching to the facts and then challenge that meaning with the      truth. Often times it means seeking counsel from others so we can      recognize reality and allow truth to set us free. </p>  </body></html>
