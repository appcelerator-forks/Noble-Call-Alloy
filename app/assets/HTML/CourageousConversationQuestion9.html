Based on the above, what is the one thing we cannot fail to do?</h1>    <p>Questions 8 &amp; 9 have to do with making Powerful Plans. This question      helps us focus on one thing that will make all the difference if we      execute it with consistency and excellence. We are looking for one thing      that will help us move towards the preferable future. It is an idea such      as <em>&#8220;We cannot fail to communicate.&#8221;</em> It is an objective that is      simply understood by everyone. For a doctor going into surgery, the one      thing he cannot fail to do is wash his hands well or everything else he      does will be rendered inconsequential. What is the one thing that you      cannot fail to do or everything else will be rendered inconsequential?      Understanding this one thing puts you on the path to making peace.</p>  </body></html>
