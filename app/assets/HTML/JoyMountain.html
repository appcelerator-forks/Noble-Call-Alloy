    <p>This diagram shows the states that we go through on a normal cycle,
      represented by the circle on the left. It usually starts with a <strong>desire</strong>
      <button type="button" class="bibleref">James 4:1-11</button> but it meets
      <strong>resistors</strong>, things that come against the desire. They
      might be physical or financial limitations or it could simply be your
      spouse, who in your opinion, is not cooperating. <button type="button" class="bibleref">James 4:6</button> This leads to <strong>conflict</strong> with usually
      predictable results. When we work from our desires and our flesh we often
      do and say things that we regret later. <button type="button" class="bibleref">Proverbs 13:10</button> When we realize that we've stepped outside of God's
      boundaries we feel <strong>guilty</strong>. <button type="button" class="bibleref">Leviticus 5:17</button> This causes us to <strong>blame</strong> others in order
      to feel better about ourselves but this is a fallacy. It really doesn't
      make us feel better at all. <button type="button" class="bibleref">Proverbs 14:3</button> At this point we have a <strong>decision</strong>: we can
      continue on the normal cycle of judgment <button type="button" class="bibleref">Genesis 3:10</button> or be courageous and take the noble path. </p>
    <p> If we follow the normal cycle, we feel <strong>ashamed</strong> for our
      actions, our guilt, and our blaming. <button type="button" class="bibleref">Proverbs 11:2</button> We enter into <strong>condemnation</strong> where the
      autofocus=""<button type="button" class="bibleref">Proverbs 29:23</button>
      We get <strong>apathetic</strong>: "Things will never change.", "I'm not
      good enough", "I don't deserve better", "Why bother?" and sit <strong>helplessly</strong>
      focused our on own discomfort and shortcomings. This leads to <strong>regret</strong>,
      where we mull over our actions and choices and what we could have done
      differently. We then <strong>fear</strong> that things won't change, that
      we'll be trapped, and that there is no way out. This then leads to a <strong>desire</strong>
      to change things again, starting the cycle over.</p>
    <p>The noble path requires courage to <strong>recognize reality</strong>:
      what the facts are, what your desires are, and whether they are Godly. It
      requires us to <strong>receive reproof</strong> for those things that we
      are responsible for, to <strong>repent</strong> for them, and <strong>reveal
        vulnerably</strong>what we really need and what our fears and weakness
      are. This means that we need to <strong>surrender</strong> our outcome
      (the desire) and trust God to deliver. Taking this path consistently with
      your spouse will show that you have <strong>willingness</strong> to
      understand and change where appropriate, a deep intimate <strong>understanding</strong>
      of your spouse, leading to greater <strong>love</strong>, <strong>peace</strong>
      in your household, and <strong>joy</strong> in each other and God. </p>
    <p>That is the Noble Path.</p>
